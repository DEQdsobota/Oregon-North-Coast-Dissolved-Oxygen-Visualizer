# North Coast Dissolved Oxygen
This R Shiny application visualizes and provides basic analyses for continuous dissolved oxygen and associated parameter data from rivers and estuaries in Oregon's North Coast region over the past decade. The application contains a mapping feature, several ways to graph raw data and summary statistics for continuous dissolved oxygen data, and the capacity to download data in several formats that can be imported into other analysis software.

The application brings in data from the Oregon AWQMS database in a flat data file named "ShinyAllData.Rdata." We are working toward linking the app dynamically with ODEQ's AWQMS database with internal R servers in the near future.
